<h1>About Me</h1>
<body>
    <p>Hello visitor! I'm glad that you took the time to check out my website! A little about me, I am a Korean-American born and raised
        in the suburbs of Chicago, IL. I am currently a Junior in the Computer Science program at Brigham Young University. I am an avid learner
        and, when I am not learning coding languages, I love learning new languages. I speak English and Korean fluently, and am currently studying
        Mandarin, Spanish, and American Sign Language.
